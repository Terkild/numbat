# Installation
We now provide a ready-to-run Docker container that includes the package and all prerequisites (see section [Docker](#docker)). Alternatively, you can follow the installation procedure below.

Numbat uses cellsnp-lite for generating SNP pileup data and eagle2 for phasing. Please follow their installation instructions and make sure their binary executables can be found in your $PATH.

1. [cellsnp-lite](https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cellsnp-lite)
2. [eagle2](https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/Eagle/)
3. [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)

Additionally, Numbat needs a common SNP VCF and phasing reference panel. You can use the 1000 Genome reference below:

4. 1000G SNP VCF
```
# hg38
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/cellsnp/files/SNPlist/genome1K.phase3.SNP_AF5e2.chr1toX.hg38.vcf.gz
# hg19
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/cellsnp/files/SNPlist/genome1K.phase3.SNP_AF5e2.chr1toX.hg19.vcf.gz
```

5. 1000G Reference Panel
```
# hg38
wget http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/teng/data/1000G_hg38.zip
# hg19
wget http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/teng/data/1000G_hg19.zip
```

You can install the numbat R package via:
```
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/kharchenkolab/numbat")
```

## Docker
We provide a ready-to-run Docker container that includes the Numbat R package and all of its dependencies. You can launch it as follows:
```
docker run -v /work:/mnt/mydata -it pkharchenkolab/numbat-rbase:latest /bin/bash
```
where `/work` is a local data folder you would like to access and write to. Within the container, `cellsnp-lite`, `eagle2` and `samtools` are available in path and the 1000 Genome SNP VCF and phasing panel files (hg38) are stored under `/data`. You can also launch R and run interactive analysis using Numbat (or run an R script).

# Preparing data
1. Prepare the allele data. Run the preprocessing script (`pileup_and_phase.R`) to count alleles and phase SNPs.

```
usage: pileup_and_phase.R [-h] --label LABEL --samples SAMPLES --bams BAMS
                          [--barcodes BARCODES] --gmap GMAP [--eagle EAGLE]
                          --snpvcf SNPVCF --paneldir PANELDIR --outdir OUTDIR
                          --ncores NCORES [--UMItag UMITAG]
                          [--cellTAG CELLTAG] [--smartseq] [--bulk]

Run SNP pileup and phasing with 1000G

Arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --label LABEL        Individual label
  --samples SAMPLES    Sample names, comma delimited
  --bams BAMS          BAM files, one per sample, comma delimited
  --barcodes BARCODES  Cell barcode files, one per sample, comma delimited
  --gmap GMAP          Path to genetic map provided by Eagle2 (e.g.
                       Eagle_v2.4.1/tables/genetic_map_hg38_withX.txt.gz)
  --eagle EAGLE        Path to Eagle2 binary file
  --snpvcf SNPVCF      SNP VCF for pileup
  --paneldir PANELDIR  Directory to phasing reference panel (BCF files)
  --outdir OUTDIR      Output directory
  --ncores NCORES      Number of cores
```

For example, within the Numbat Docker [container](#docker) you can run the preprocessing script like this:
```
Rscript /numbat/pileup_and_phase.R \
    --label {sample} \
    --samples {sample} \
    --bams /mnt/mydata/{sample}_BAM.bam \
    --barcodes /mnt/mydata/{sample}_barcodes.tsv \
    --outdir /mnt/mydata/{sample} \
    --gmap /Eagle_v2.4.1/tables/genetic_map_hg38_withX.txt.gz \
    --snpvcf /data/genome1K.phase3.SNP_AF5e2.chr1toX.hg38.vcf \
    --paneldir /data/1000G_hg38 \
    --ncores ncores
```

This will produce a file named `{sample}_allele_counts.tsv.gz` under the specified output directory, which contains cell-level phased allele counts. If multiple samples from the same individual was provided, there will be one allele count file for each sample. Other outputs include phased vcfs under `phasing/` folder and raw pileup counts under `pileup/`.

2. Prepare the expression data. Numbat takes a gene by cell integer UMI count matrix as input. You can directly use results from upstream transcriptome quantification pipelines such as 10x CellRanger.
  
3. Prepare the expression reference, which is a gene by cell type matrix of normalized expression values (raw gene counts divided by total counts). For a quick start, you may use a our HCA collection (`ref_hca`) that ships with the package. If you have matched normal cells (ideally, of various cell type) from the same patient or dataset and would like to make your own references, you may use this utility function:

```
# count_mat is a gene x cell raw count matrices
# cell_annot is a dataframe with columns "cell" and "group"
ref_internal = aggregate_counts(count_mat, cell_annot)
```

# Running Numbat
  
In this example (ATC2 from [Gao et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-00795-2)), the gene expression count matrix and allele dataframe are already prepared for you.
```
library(numbat)

count_mat_ATC2 = readRDS(url('http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/teng/data/count_mat_ATC2.rds'))
df_allele_ATC2 = readRDS(url('http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/teng/data/df_allele_ATC2.rds'))

# run
out = run_numbat(
    count_mat_ATC2, # gene x cell integer UMI count matrix 
    ref_hca, # reference expression profile, a gene x cell type normalized expression level matrix
    df_allele_ATC2, # allele dataframe generated by pileup_and_phase script
    gtf_hg38, # provided upon loading the package
    genome = "hg38",
    t = 1e-5,
    ncores = 4,
    plot = TRUE,
    out_dir = './test'
)
```
**Note**: If you wish to use your own custom reference, please use the `aggregate_counts` function as per the example in [preparing data](#preparing-data). You do not need to include the reference cells in `count_mat` or `df_allele`; only provide them as `lambdas_ref`.

## Run parameters
There are a few parameters you can consider tuning to a specific dataset. 
  
*CNV detection*

- `t`: the transition probability used in the HMM. A lower `t` is more appropriate for tumors with more complex copy number landscapes (from which you can expect more breakpoints) and is sometimes better for detecting subclonal events. A higher `t` is more effective for controlling false-positive rates of CNV calls.
- `gamma`: Overdispersion in allele counts (default: 20). For 10x data, 20 is recommended. Non-UMI protocols (e.g. SMART-Seq) usually produce noisier allele data, and a smaller value of gamma is recommended (e.g. 5). 
- `min_cells`: minimum number of cells for which an pseudobulk HMM will be run. If the allele coverage per cell is very sparse for a dataset, then I would consider setting this threshold to be higher.
- `multi_allelic`: Whether to enable calling of multiallelic CNVs
  
*CNV filtering*

- `min_LLR`: minimum log-likelihood ratio threshold to filter CNVs (default: 5). To ensure quality of phylogeny inference, we only use confident CNVs to reconstruct the phylogeny.
- `max_entropy`: another criteria that we use to filter CNVs before phylogeny construction (default: 0.5). The entropy of the binary posterior quantifies the uncertainty of an event across single cells. The value can be from 0 to 1 where 1 is the least stringent.
  
*Phylogeny*

- `tau`: Stringency to simplify the mutational history (0-1). A higher `tau` produces less clones and a more simplified evolutionary history.

*Iterative optimization*

- `init_k`: initial number of subclusters to use for the `hclust` initialization. Numbat by default uses hierarchical clustering (`hclust`) of smoothed expression values to approximate an initial phylogeny. This will cut the initial tree into k clusters. More clusters means more resolution at the initial stage for subclonal CNV detection. By default, we set init_k to be 3.
- `max_iter`: maximum number of iterations. Numbat iteratively optimizes the phylogeny and copy number estimations. In practice, we find that results after 2 iterations are usually stable.  
- `check_convergence`: stop iterating if the results have converged (based on consensus CNV segments).

*Parallelization*

- `ncores`: number of cores to use for single-cell CNV testing
- `ncores_nni`: number of cores to use for phylogeny inference

## Detecting clonal LOH
For cell line data and high-purity tumors, we recommend running the below procedure to identify and exclude regions of clonal deletions/LOH before running Numbat. To do so, aggregate all cells into a pseudobulk, and run the SNP-density HMM:
```
bulk = get_bulk(
    count_mat = count_mat,
    lambdas_ref = ref_hca,
    df_allele = df_allele,
    gtf = gtf_hg38,
    genetic_map = genetic_map_hg38
)

segs_loh = bulk %>% detect_clonal_loh(t = 1e-4)
```

Then pass `segs_loh` to the Numbat run for those regions to be excluded from baseline during analysis.

```
out = run_numbat(
    ....,
    segs_loh = segs_loh
)
```

# Understanding results
